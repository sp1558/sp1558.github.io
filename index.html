    <div class="about-me">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at the Rutgers Business School double majoring in Business Analytics & Information Technology and Finance. I am working towards cultivating new connections and experience as I explore the intersection between business analytics and the finance industry and what it has to offer. I am currently delving into the fields of financial management, fin-tech, and investment banking to discover the vast connections and impact that business finance has within our everyday lives. Through my experience with patient care along with data management, I have advanced my assessment skills and attentive ability, which I yearn to utilize through new opportunities in the greater NYC metropolitan area.</p>
